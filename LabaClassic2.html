                <br>
                <br>
                The earliest known tarot decks were used for playing games similar to modern-day bridge or poker. It was in the 18th century that tarot began to be used for guidance and fortune-telling.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some historians believe that ancient Egyptian, Jewish, and Christian mystical traditions influenced the images on the tarot cards. Others suggest that the images were inspired by the Italian Renaissance and its fascination with the occult and esoteric knowledge.

            <td class="right-block-1">The popularization of esoteric tarot started with Antoine Court and Jean-Baptiste Alliette (Etteilla) in Paris during the 1780s, using the Tarot of Marseilles. French tarot players abandoned the Marseilles tarot in favor of the Tarot Nouveau around 1900, with the result that the Marseilles pattern is now used mostly by cartomancers.</td>
